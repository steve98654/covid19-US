This is an interactive visualization that allows one to monitor daily COVID-19 patient 
confirmed case, death, and recovery counts in the United States. It is sourced from US 
CDC data maintained at: 

https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

which will update automatically to the latest available data upon running this IPython notebook

Set datatype to 'Confirmed Cases', 'Deaths', or 'Recovered' depending on the type of 
information you are interested in visualizing.
