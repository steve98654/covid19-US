This is an interactive visualization that allows one to monitor daily COVID-19 patient 
confirmed case, death, and recovery counts in the United States at the state level. It is sourced from US 
CDC data maintained at: 

https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

and the visualization will incorporate the latest available data upon running the IPython notebook.

Set datatype to 'Confirmed Cases', 'Deaths', or 'Recovered' depending on the type of 
information you are interested in displaying.
